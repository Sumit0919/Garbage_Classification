        "Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a different but related task. It also allows us to build accurate models in a time-saving way by starting from patterns learned when solving a different problem. This approach is beneficial when there is limited data for the new task, as the pre-trained model already has learned features that can be adapted. Transfer learning can significantly improve models' performance and efficiency in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.BenefitsReduces training time — you don't start from scratch.Leverages learned features from large datasets (like ImageNet).Improves performance, especially with limited data.How Does It Work?Load a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).Freeze the pretrained layers (optional).Add new layers for your custom task.Train on your new dataset (can also fine-tune).EfficientNetV2B2: Transfer Learning Backbone\n",
